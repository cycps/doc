# Cypress Synopsis
Cypress is an experimental design engine for internetworked cyber-physical systems. An internetworked cyber-physical (ICPS) system typically is made up of the following.

- Computer Networks
- Physical Networks
- Sensors & Actuators
- Distributed Monitoring & Control Software

Take for example, the power grid. Computer networks comprise the computers, routers, and switches that interconnect substations and subsequently monitoring and control systems. Physical networks comprise the generators, transformers, transmission lines, busbars and load centres that connect society to electric power. Sensors and actuators are the conduit by which the computer and physical are themselves connected. Taken together these components are an ICPS.

Cypress allows users to design ICPS system experiments and instantiate them in a hybrid simulated-physical emulated-cyber (SPEC) environment. This is accomplished through the combination of the following.

- Graphical Modeling Environment
- ICPS Data Model 
- ICPS Model Analysis and Interrogation Algorithm Suite
- Automated Experimentation Runtime
- Simulation Engine for Network Control Environments
